I want to start writing command line tool call CodeValue Architect Assistant 
that will work like Aider or as MCP server.
The tool should help architect in reverse enginering existing projects, 
should be able to analize repository, create dependency map,
find core use-cases, create flow and sequence diagrams in maremaid or pluntuml.

Create me the advanced prompt to be used by code assitant tools like Aider, Cluade Code or Roo Code 
to create CodeValue Architect Assistant.
