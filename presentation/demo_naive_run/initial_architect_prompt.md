# Initial prompt

I want to start writing command line tool call CodeValue Architect Assistant 
that will work like Aider and in next version as MCP server.
The tool should help architect in following tasks, using LLM abilities:
1) reverse enginering existing projects
2) should be able to analize existing code-base repository
3) create dependency map
4) find core use-cases
5) create flow and sequence mermaid diagrams

# Propmt for Prompt-Perfect
Create me the advanced prompt to be used by code assitant tools like Aider, Cluade Code or Roo Code 
to create CodeValue Architect Assistant.

# Roo Code Enchanced prompt
Design and implement a command-line tool named CodeValue Architect Assistant, inspired by Aider, with future plans to evolve into an MCP server. The tool should leverage LLM capabilities to assist architects by performing advanced tasks such as reverse engineering existing projects, analyzing entire codebase repositories, generating comprehensive dependency maps, identifying core use-cases, and automatically creating flow and sequence diagrams in Mermaid format.
