# Initial Prompt

I need to create presentation based on `Vibe Coding.pptx` power point template for a halkf an hour lecture.

I wrote few notes in readme.md

I want to show few slides:
- Few citattes, projects, aquisitionsa
- Show the table of different VIbe Coding tools per category (No/Low Code, IDE based tools, Command Line Assistents, VS Code Extensions and Asynchronous Agents)

At the middle of presentaion I want to switch to VS Code to show real time presentation of creating of CodeValue Architect Assistant, starting with initial promot that can be found in readmemd `Start with initial Basic prompt`.

Then I'll switch back to presentation and will show the results of naive run - with auto-approve - the results can be found in `take1.md` file

Will talk about best practices of Vibe Coding

Then will switch back to VS Code in another folder and will start to create same `CodeValue Architect Assistant`, using best practices of Roo Code usage.

Then I'll switch back to presentation and will show the results of Take2 ( the 2nd full run - that I'll complete shortly) and will show the results in the slide.

Then I switch back to the VS Code and will try to run the tool created in Take2.

# After enchancing
Generate a 30-minute lecture presentation on 'Vibe Coding' using the `Vibe Coding.pptx` template, incorporating notes from `readme.md` and demonstrating practical application in VS Code. The presentation flow should be as follows: Begin with presentation slides featuring relevant quotes, projects, acquisitions, and a detailed table categorizing Vibe Coding tools by type: No/Low Code, IDE-based tools, Command Line Assistants, VS Code Extensions, and Asynchronous Agents. Transition to VS Code for a live demonstration of creating the 'CodeValue Architect Assistant', starting with the initial prompt specified in `readme.md` under `Start with initial Basic prompt`. Subsequently, switch back to the presentation to display the results of this naive run (with auto-approve), referencing `take1.md`, and then discuss Vibe Coding best practices. Following this, return to VS Code in a separate folder to demonstrate the creation of the same 'CodeValue Architect Assistant', this time applying the discussed best practices of Roo Code usage. Finally, switch back to the presentation to show the results of this second full run (Take2), which will be completed shortly and referenced from `take2.md`, before concluding by switching back to VS Code to run the tool created in Take2.
