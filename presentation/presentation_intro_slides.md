## Core Concepts of AI Coding

### The "Big 3"
- **Context**: The information provided to the AI model.
- **Model**: The AI engine processing the context and generating responses.
- **Prompt**: The instructions or query given to the AI model.

### Best Practices and Rules

## Architect Assistant: Vision and Functionality

### Problem Statement
- Challenges in current software architecture:
    - Complexity of large codebases
    - Difficulty in understanding dependencies
    - Manual effort in documentation and diagramming

### CodeValue Architect Assistant
- A command-line tool working like Aider.
- Assists architects in:
    - Reverse engineering existing projects
    - Analyzing repositories
    - Creating dependency maps
    - Finding core use-cases
    - Generating flow and sequence diagrams (Mermaid/PlantUML)
- All these functionalities must use LLM
