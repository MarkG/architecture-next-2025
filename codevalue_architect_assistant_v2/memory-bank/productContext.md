## Project Goal
 
Develop 'CodeValue Architect Assistant,' a command-line tool leveraging advanced LLM capabilities to function as an interactive architectural assistant.
 
## Key Features
 
*   Interactive code editing and analysis, similar to Aider.
*   Deep architectural discovery and reverse engineering of existing projects.
*   Comprehensive codebase analysis for design patterns, anti-patterns, and security vulnerabilities.
*   Automated generation of dependency maps.
*   Intelligent extraction of core use cases and key functionalities.
*   Automatic generation of system behavior and interaction diagrams (flow and sequence) in Mermaid syntax.
 
## Overall Architecture
 
The tool will be a command-line application that evolves into a Model-Code-Platform (MCP) server.
