## Decision

*   **[2025-06-15 17:48:00]** - **Technology Stack Selection:** Decided to use Python for the core application logic due to its extensive libraries for code analysis and CLI development.
      
## Rationale 

*   The choice of Python allows for rapid development and access to mature libraries like `click` for the command-line interface and `pygit2` for interacting with Git repositories. This stack aligns with the project's goal of creating a powerful and extensible analysis tool.

## Implementation Details

*   The initial implementation will use the `click` library to build the CLI structure. The `setup.py` file will manage dependencies, starting with `click` and `pygit2`.
