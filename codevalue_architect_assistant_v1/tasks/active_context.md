# Active Context: CodeValue Architect Assistant

**Date:** 2025-04-08 *(Updated)*

## Current Focus

- **Phase:** Initial Implementation Complete.
- **Activity:** Preparing to present the initial version of the tool based on the completed phases (1-6, and parts of 8).

## Recent Changes

- Completed **Phase 8 Tasks (Partial)**:
    - Wrote initial `README.md` (Task 8.1).
    - Refined CLI: Added packaging (`pyproject.toml`), updated README usage, added `--output` option to `map-deps` (Task 8.2).
    - Reviewed basic error handling and logging (Task 8.3).
- Completed **Phase 6: Use-Case Identification Module (Initial Pattern Matching)**:
    - Implemented Regex-based pattern matching and integrated into `find-use-cases` command.
    - Added unit tests.
- Completed **Phase 5: Diagram Generation Module**:
    - Implemented Mermaid and PlantUML generation.
    - Integrated into `map-deps` command.
    - Added unit tests.
- Completed **Phase 4: Dependency Mapping Module (JavaScript)**:
    - Implemented JS Regex parsing and resolution.
    - Integrated into `map-deps` command.
    - Added unit tests.
- Completed **Phase 3: Dependency Mapping Module (Python)**:
    - Implemented Python AST parsing and resolution.
    - Integrated into `map-deps` command.
    - Added unit tests.
- Completed **Phase 2: Repository Analysis Module**:
    - Implemented repository scanning, filtering, and language detection.
    - Integrated into the `analyze` CLI command.
    - Added unit tests.
- Completed **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure**:
    - Set up project structure, Git, dependencies, CLI, models, logging, and testing.
- Created initial versions of all core memory files.
- Updated `tasks/tasks_plan.md` to reflect Phase 1-6 and partial Phase 8 completion.

## Key Decisions / Assumptions Made

- The project will be developed using Python 3.8+.
- `click` is used for the CLI interface.
- `networkx` is used for graph representation.
- Initial focus is on analyzing Python and JavaScript codebases.
- Dependency analysis uses AST for Python and Regex for JavaScript.
- Diagram generation targets Mermaid and PlantUML text formats.
- Use-case identification uses initial Regex pattern matching.
- Packaging is set up via `pyproject.toml`.

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  Present the current implementation to the user using `attempt_completion`.
2.  Address feedback or proceed to deferred tasks (Phase 7 research, integration tests, further refinement) based on user input.

## Blockers / Issues

- Phase 7 (Flow/Sequence Diagram Generation) requires research and is not implemented.
- Integration testing (Task 8.4) is not yet implemented.
- Final review/update of all memory files (Task 8.5) is pending.

## Open Questions / Considerations

- **Pattern Effectiveness:** How effective will the initial simple patterns be?
- **Use-Case Representation:** How should identified use-cases be represented and summarized?
- **Dependency Scope:** How to differentiate/handle standard library, project-internal, and third-party imports?
- **JS Resolver Complexity:** The initial Regex + path logic for JS might need refinement.
- **Diagram Complexity:** How to handle very large graphs?
- Need to detail strategy for flow/sequence diagram generation (Phase 7).
