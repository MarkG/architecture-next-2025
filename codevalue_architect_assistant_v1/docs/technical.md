# Technical Specification: CodeValue Architect Assistant

## 1. Overview

This document details the technical stack, development environment, key technical decisions, and constraints for the CodeValue Architect Assistant tool. It complements the Product Requirement Document and the Architecture Document.

## 2. Development Environment

- **Programming Language:** Python (Version 3.8 or higher recommended for `ast` improvements and features).
- **Package Management:** `pip` with `requirements.txt` for managing dependencies.
- **Virtual Environment:** Standard Python `venv` module is recommended for isolating project dependencies.
- **Version Control:** Git. The project repository should be managed using Git.

## 3. Core Technologies & Libraries

- **CLI Framework:** `click` - Chosen for its ease of use, composability for complex command structures, and automatic help generation.
- **File System Interaction:** Python's built-in `os` and `pathlib` modules.
- **Code Parsing:**
    - **Python:** Built-in `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) module for accurate analysis of code structure and dependencies (imports).
    - **JavaScript:** Regular Expressions (`re` module) for initial identification of `require` and `import` statements. (Note: This is less robust than AST parsing; a dedicated JS parser like `esprima` could be considered later).
    - **General:** `chardet` or similar library might be needed for reliably detecting file encodings.
- **Dependency Analysis & Graphing:** `networkx` - For creating, manipulating, and analyzing the graph structure representing dependencies.
- **Diagram Generation:** String templating (e.g., using f-strings or a lightweight templating engine like Jinja2 if complexity increases) to generate Mermaid and PlantUML syntax.
- **Git Integration (Optional):** `subprocess` module could be used for basic Git commands, but dedicated libraries like `GitPython` might offer a more robust interface if deeper integration is needed later.

## 4. Key Technical Decisions

- **Language Choice:** Python was selected for its strong ecosystem for text processing, data analysis (NetworkX), AST manipulation, and general scripting suitability for CLI tools.
- **CLI Framework:** `click` preferred over `argparse` for better handling of nested commands and options.
- **Parsing Strategy:** Prioritize AST parsing for supported languages (Python initially) as it's more accurate than regex. Use regex as a fallback or for simpler languages/tasks.
- **Dependency Representation:** Use `networkx` graphs to model dependencies, allowing for graph algorithms and analysis in the future.
- **Visualization:** Focus on text-based diagram formats (Mermaid, PlantUML) for ease of generation, version control compatibility, and integration with documentation tools. Static image generation is a potential future addition.
- **Initial Language Focus:** Start with Python and JavaScript support to manage initial complexity, with the architecture designed for adding more languages later.

## 5. Design Patterns

- **Modular Design:** As outlined in `docs/architecture.md`, separating concerns into distinct modules (Analysis, Dependencies, Use-Cases, Diagrams).
- **Command Pattern:** Implicitly used by `click` to map CLI commands to specific functions/logic.
- **Strategy Pattern (Potential):** Can be used later to implement different parsing strategies for various languages or different diagram generation logic.

## 6. Technical Constraints & Considerations

- **Performance:** Parsing large codebases, especially with AST, can be resource-intensive (CPU and memory). Need to consider efficiency, potentially processing files in parallel or using caching where appropriate.
- **Parsing Accuracy:** Regex-based parsing for languages like JavaScript can be brittle. Relying on AST is preferred where feasible.
- **External Dependencies:** The tool relies on Python and its libraries. Installation requires `pip`. If Git integration is added via `subprocess`, it assumes `git` is installed and in the system PATH.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python and the chosen libraries are generally cross-platform, but file path handling and external command execution (`subprocess`) need care.

## 7. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Use `pytest` or `unittest` to test individual functions and classes within each module (e.g., test parsing functions, graph creation logic, diagram template generation). Mock file system interactions and external dependencies.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the CLI commands end-to-end, using sample code snippets or small test repositories. Verify output formats and command behavior.
