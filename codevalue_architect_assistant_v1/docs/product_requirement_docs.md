# Product Requirement Document: CodeValue Architect Assistant

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the "CodeValue Architect Assistant", a command-line tool designed to assist software architects in the process of reverse-engineering existing software projects.

## 2. Problem Statement

Software architects often face the challenge of understanding large, complex, or unfamiliar codebases. Manually analyzing repositories, mapping dependencies, identifying core functionalities, and visualizing system flows is time-consuming and error-prone. There is a need for an automated tool to streamline this reverse-engineering process.

## 3. Goals

The primary goal of the CodeValue Architect Assistant is to provide architects with automated tools to:
- Quickly understand the structure and components of a codebase.
- Visualize dependencies between different parts of the system.
- Identify the main use-cases and functionalities.
- Generate diagrams illustrating system flows and interactions.

## 4. Core Requirements

The tool must provide the following core functionalities:

### 4.1. Repository Analysis
- Scan and analyze existing code repositories (initially focusing on Git).
- Identify and catalog all files and directories.
- Detect programming languages used (initially Python and JavaScript).
- Identify significant libraries/frameworks incorporated.

### 4.2. Dependency Map Creation
- Analyze dependencies within the project (imports/requires for Python/JavaScript).
- Generate a dependency map outlining relationships between files/modules.
- Present dependency data visually using Mermaid or PlantUML formats.

### 4.3. Core Use-Cases Identification
- Identify and summarize core use-cases based on code analysis (starting with pattern matching).
- Highlight key functionalities and features.

### 4.4. Flow and Sequence Diagram Generation
- Generate flow diagrams illustrating overall system processes.
- Create sequence diagrams detailing interactions between system components.
- Output diagrams in Mermaid or PlantUML formats.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** The tool should be user-friendly with clear command-line interface (CLI) and feedback.
- **Compatibility:** Must work with Git repositories.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to potentially support more languages and features in the future.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and logging.
- **Documentation:** Clear installation, configuration, and usage documentation.

## 6. Target Users

- Software Architects
- Senior Developers
- Technical Leads
